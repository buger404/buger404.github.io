# 4.15 新冰棍秘密笔记

## 写作建议

* 像这种essay一般不会用my或者I，用客观的句子写而不是主观

  > e.g.   I think xx -> It is believed that xx

* There is no doubt ->  It's undoubted  /  Undoubtedly

* ~~could可以让语气更委婉？~~

  > 我觉得不是，当你让别人帮你做事的时候才这样，例如：
  >
  > Can you please xxx -> Could you please xxx

* 避免中文直译

* governments -> the government，保持统一，避免文章一会儿governments一会儿the government

* It is clearly -> It is obvious

* 若使用了First，尽量后面也使用Second, Third...

* 注意指代误用

* 引言应该来自interview而不是survey

* 不要用语文的方式写英语

* 不允许整段引言写作

* the reasons for xxx are as **explained** above

* 英语作文主要考察的是语法和表达

  > 考官也不会看你写的是不是符合事实。
  >
  > 考官只是看你怎么表达，还有你的语法词汇。

* For example -> For instance

  > **写作时应在文章中包含相同含义的不同表达方式。**
  >
  > 除此之外你可以使用（重点句式）：
  >
  > **A good example that illustrate my point of view is that xxx**

## 细节

* In my view 应放置在句子开头
* what would happen 后面不要加ed
* traffic使用easy属于搭配不当，应用 smoother 和 more efficient

## 词汇和短语扩充

* stimulate：刺激；激发

  > inspire是指激发某个人的想法 比如：xxx is inspired by a book
  >
  > 因此刺激经济发展不应使用inspire而是stimulate

* urban area：城区

* daily do sth -> do sth on a daily basis

* to conclude：总而言之（作文结尾可用）

* in a nutshell：简言之（作文结尾可用）

* put in the first place = priority

* put in the second place -> considered secondary

* budget：把…编入预算，预算

* fulfill：做完(工作)；达到(目的)；应验(预言等)；满足(希望)

## 昨日挑战结果（今日围绕的文章）

* 原文：

​    Should governments spend money on railways rather than roads?
​    There is no doubt that my answer is NO. With the development of the human culture, roads are gradually becoming an important role in our daily life.
​    Building roads could develop economy more effective than building railways in my view. For example, if governments spend money on roads rather than railways, what would happened? First, it is clearly that the traffic will become easier and faster. In addition, they could inspire the progress of economy. For example, there are many shops, gas station, and service station along the road, the development of roads could bring them chances to earn money. Railways could make a great contribution to the transportation of the agriculture products as well. In the countryside, people’s daily going out is not so easy, and it is hard for farmers to transport their products in most countryside. But building roads could solve this problem perfectly. 
​    “To be honest, building railways did not make my life easier.” According to a recent survey, a 24-woman said. Therefore, governments should spend money on what could satisfied people first. It will help people work more effective and live happier.
​    The reasons for my opinion are as above. Building roads is what the governments should do rather than building railways. For me, people should be put in the first place while the development of economy should be put in the second place. Governments should balance their cost to something meaningful.

* 评价：

  > 然后这段原本的结尾不够好 这也是我把上面两句互换位置的原因 换了之后我就可以用Even though来连接 然后带出我的观点: 即使railway有xx优点, 建公路也可以解决问题。
  >
  > 如果是我的话最后一段第一句应该是类似于to conclude之类的
