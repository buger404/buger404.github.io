# Lose hopes again

I truly have not a proper place to rest in the real world.

They gossiped that my quality is strange.

But I really tried my best to show them my kindness.

**If you see this text, I believe that you are again bored of me.**

**PLEASE EXIT**

# Go home with my classmate

I lived outside the school now, and I can go home with my classmate now.

I was so happy at first.

However.

I think **he is bored .... of me**.

When other classmates passed by and we are walking together, they smiled to him and greet to him and.......

They never noticed me or **they don't want to greet me**.

"Hello" with **no replying**.

# My best friend? There?

I can't always make jokes with my best friend, he always feels that I'm attacking him.

Maybe that's my fault.

**EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT.**

And also I can't talk with him happily.

When I share my achievements with him, he .......

always made me unhappy and ...

**UNHAPPY**

# I at least have a friend named Icelolly, take it easy?

But I found maybe Icelolly doesn't consider me as a best friend as I consider him as my best best friend.

He seemed that he is bored of me.

Actually I can't use PC.....

Whenever I use it in my school, I could be caught by teachers.

I opened my program happily to say good-night to him.....

Sometimes I can't keep talking with him because I would be caught.

Maybe that seemed I don't want to talk with him however I don't have that idea.



I just want to chat with him, share my happiness, and ....

Concerned about him.

I follow his blog, his projects, his posts and .............

I just want to have a connection with him.

Just that

**Just that**



Maybe I have not my best friend.



When I suggest him to have a blog, he just refused.

When Sun+Ice suggested that, he did it.

I know his best friend is Sun+Ice.

But what position is me in his heart?

# Want to cry

I don't know who I can tell my feelings to and .... how can you understand me.

I truly know this text **won't be read**.

But I still want to write it.

For me.

FOR MYSELF.

MYSELF.

SELF.



**I TRULY DON'T LIKE SELF.**
